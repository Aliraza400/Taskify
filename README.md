# Taskify
I've created Taskify, a versatile task management app designed to simplify organizing your to-do list. With Taskify, you can effortlessly add new tasks, which are then saved to local storage, ensuring that your tasks persist even after you close the app. This feature provides a reliable way to keep track of your tasks without the worry of losing your data.

One of the key features of Taskify is its intuitive delete button, which allows you to remove tasks with a single click. This functionality helps keep your task list clutter-free and focused only on what’s important. The app’s user-friendly interface and smooth performance make managing tasks a breeze, providing a streamlined experience for effective organization and productivity.
